# Hello Wolrd

To run this script you will have to install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Then install this packages
```
npm install --save domparser
```
```
npm install --save jsdom
```
```
npm install request --save
```

I recommend you to install `Code Runner` extension on VSCode to simply hit the play button and run this script.

Or you can run it by installing nodemoon and executing on terminal:
```
npm i -g nodemon
```
```
nodemon get_week_schedule.js
```

Use this script with a API in your application and start registering events automatically.

Hope you enjoy it!
